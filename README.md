COMMUNICATION PLAN

 Methods of Communication: Slack for day-to-day conversation and syncing. Email for a more formal and documented way of communication.

 Communication response times: All team members try to communicate at the earliest possible time. Any absence or away-from-work status is intimated in the communication channel.

 Meeting attendance: Meeting attendance is not fully mandatory. This implies that it is not necessary for all team members to attend every meeting but at least 3 out of 5 members need to be present. The ones not attending shall inform the rest well in advance. It is appreciated if all can attend anyways.

 Version control: All changes by the team members are pushed to the artifact by raising pull requests which are first reviewed by the peers before merging.

 Division of work: Work is divided between the team members in the form modules. Any overload can be brought to the notice of the other members so it can be divided or redistributed.

BUSINESS PROBLEM, OPPORTUNITY, DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BUSINESS PROBLEM The dataset presents CSV files of flood statistics for the 48 contiguous states at the congressional district, county, and zip code level. The CSV for each of these geographical extents includes statistics on the number of properties at risk according to FEMA, the number of properties at risk according to First Street Foundation. The flood statistics data can help us understand and gain insights on how well the government or an organization needs to be prepared to during floods and helps us to get an estimate of the damages that would incur.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND QUESTIONS

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

Using the historical data from FEMA and First street foundation, we aim to predict the number of properties that would be affected in case of floods with various risk factors. We also intent to study data from the two organizations and provide a comparative analysis of how each organization calculates the number of properties affected with floods of various risk scores.

EXAMPLE DESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS

Comparing the annual peak flows by regions (for a tenure of 10 years or more)
Where are there unexpectedly high building and content loss, given the number of structures?
Identifying areas of high potential losses.
What are the historic flood outlines for each state?
EXAMPLE PREDICTIVE QUESTIONS

We will forecast the likelihood of a 100-year flood in each state in any given year?
Find the zip codes with the highest percentage of properties at risk of flooding in the future.
Find the counties in each state that are most at risk.
